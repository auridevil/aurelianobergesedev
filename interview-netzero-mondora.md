# Interview: Reformulate your Strategy if COVID-19 changes your Business - Interview to Aureliano Bergese from Mondora

## Marco Bugnano - Oct 2021

Mondora, founded in 2002, is a _software and advisory_ company specialized in customized
cloud solutions for all kind of businesses (B Lab, 2021i). It supports customers with the design,
implementation, and operation of various IT architectures and the associated teams and
governance structures, with a strong focus on the implementation and management of
technological paradigms (_ivi_). Categorized under _Service with Minor Environmental Footprint_ 
sector and under the _10-49 dimension_, the firm signs a BIA score of 122,8 points, largely driven
by Community Impact Area with 47,8 points. By supporting other firms with consulting
services and helping them to develop a sustainable and effective business management,
Mondora unlocks the SBM 8 for _developing scale-up sustainable solutions_. Several corporate
projects sustain the _environment_, while the associated Impact Area records a 17,1 score in the
latest BIA, unlocking two IBMs such _Environment Products & Services Introduction_ and
_Environmental Education & Information_ (B Lab, 2021i).

Mondora shows the B Corp certification since 2015 and successively it has also become a
Benefit Corporation. The working history of the company changed in 2020: due to the
pandemic, Mondora _closed its office_ in Berbenno in Valtellina and converted its working
modality to _full remote working_ (Mondora, 2021). Consequently, as Mr. Bergese (Mondora’s
Benefit Officer) suggested, the company is also _adapting its strategy and planning process_
towards carbon neutrality to the new, diffused network of peers that mainly work from their
homes. Mondora’s business is essentially based on cloud architectures, for which third-parties
supply servers and components to the firm. Thus, the _immaterial_ nature of the _business_ and the
_absence of offices_ allowed Mondora to reset several categories of emissions, but they also
introduced other sources of gases. As its Benefit Officer suggested, _2030 is still far_ for Mondora
but its people are understanding _how to bridge gaps_. In line with the general strategy to achieve
carbon neutrality developed along the previous chapters, Mr. Bergese agree that the first step
to formulate a net-zero strategy for Mondora entails the _measure of gas emissions_ referrable to
the working sphere of employees’ lives. Even if the _reformulation of the net-zero strategy_ will
consider a complex network of peers, the company is already taking environmental actions with
direct and indirect effects on emissions.

In terms of _transports_, its workers continue to afford business transfers to clients but with a
different policy than pre-pandemic periods: after closing of the office, business transfers have
not registered anymore expenses charged to the customer. Thus, the _new policy disincentivizes
business transfers_ to clients by charging relative expenses to Mondora, favouring the
application of solutions and the development of works through remote working modality. Then,
in front of transports, Mr. Bergese suggested that the _“No flight zone policy”_ of travel
disincentive is going to be kept on track along the successive periods. Another solution
developed by the firm is _Cycle2Work_, a web app that rewards employees for going to work by
bike or on foot, whilst safeguarding the environment (Mondora, 2021). For every kilometre
travelled in a sustainable way, the app calculates how many CO2 emissions are saved and
Mondora will provide a reward of € 0.20/km (_ivi_). The goal is the _spread_ of the Cycle2Work 
among companies, providing it either in exchange of CO2 emissions saved by their employees
(in order to sum them with Mondora’s savings), or by paying for taking rights on their savings
and utilizing them for virtuous scopes (_ivi_). As the last Impact Report (2021) introduces,
Mondora saved 30.16 kg of CO2 in front of 131.71 km in 2020, until closing the office.
Therefore, Cycle2Work is now registering lower possibilities of internal applications than pre-
pandemic periods because travels from employees’ houses to offices have been essentially
deleted.

In terms of _services_, the firm operates by exploiting _third-party systems_ which register
emissions in front of their owners. As the Benefit Officer suggested, Mondora takes into
consideration this contingency by _advising_ to clients the utilization of _big providers_ that are
also approaching net zero targets or similar environmental purposes in their businesses. After
an analysis of the impact of own technological infrastructures, Mondora defined the guidelines
for the choice of servers to utilize by choosing _two suppliers_ which have a _plan to reduce their
carbon footprints_ and show the best choice for provisions of low-impact servers: _Amazon AWS_
and _Microsoft Azure_ (Mondora, 2021). On the other, _personal computers_ utilized by workers
are involved in an impact-driven project that cares about emission embedded into them. Until
2019, Mondora operated with personal computers through a two-year leasing agreement,
without caring about the phases of product lifecycle after their collection by the supplier
(Mondora, 2021). To responsibly use them, Mondora decided to buy computers for working
purposes and to donate them to no-profit organizations after a few years, thus avoiding waste
and preserve working products (_ivi_).

In terms of _electric energy_, Mr. Bergese introduced a future project that Mondora is taking into
consideration, linked to the current way of work that leverages employees’ houses and
household utilities. By providing _incentives_, employees would be allowed to deliberately
choose to subscribe agreements of _renewable energy supply_ that would power electric systems
of their houses for both professional and personal purposes.

In the past years, people of Mondora assumed several environment-beneficial behaviours in the
office, such as: _waste reduction_, through a system capable to measure the amount of waste
produced in the office, consequently setting reduction targets and cooperating among peers to
reach them; _plastic free_, through the purchase of reusable water bottles for each employee;
_paper free_, thus avoiding use of paper and also influencing clients to limit their related uses
(Mondora, 2021). In line with Cycle2Work, Mondora launched other two projects suggesting
environmental benefits, such: _Hire a Farmer_, by which the company hires a farmer to 
_work the land_ and _grow organic produce_ for every twenty employees assumed, and _HireBitto_, 
for which it sustains farmers and cheesemakers that choose to work with traditional methods and 
_without_ the use of _chemicals or industrial machineries_ (_ivi_).

In front of the pursuit of carbon neutrality by 2030, Mr. Bergese declares about Mondora’s
people that: _“Today we want to do the world of tomorrow, without borrowing from tomorrow
but working now for tomorrow”_. Then, according to his words, a de facto commitment to carbon
neutrality was already done by the firm, prior to the call and as a natural step.
